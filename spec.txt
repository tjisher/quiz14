LCD Numbers (#14)
This week's quiz is to write a program that displays LCD style numbers at adjustable sizes.

The digits to be displayed will be passed as an argument to the program. Size should be controlled with the command-line option -s follow up by a positive integer. The default value for -s is 2.

For example, if your program is called with:

> lcd.rb 012345

The correct display is:

 --        --   --        -- 
|  |    |    |    | |  | |   
|  |    |    |    | |  | |   
           --   --   --   -- 
|  |    | |       |    |    |
|  |    | |       |    |    |
 --        --   --        -- 

And for:

> lcd.rb -s 1 6789

Your program should print:

 -   -   -   - 
|     | | | | |
 -       -   - 
| |   | | |   |
 -       -   - 

Note the single column of space between digits in both examples. For other values of -s, simply lengthen the - and | bars.
